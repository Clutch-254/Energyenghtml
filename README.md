# Kenya Energy Engineering Website

## Personal Note

Hey there! Thanks for checking out my Kenya Energy Engineering website. I want to be upfront that I haven't added the actual images for the blank image slots throughout the site yet. I'm planning to add those later after I grab something to eat - been coding for hours and need to refuel!

This project is actually a tribute to my studies in engineering. The journey through energy engineering has been incredible, and I wanted to create something that showcases both Kenya's remarkable renewable energy landscape and what I've learned during my education.

## About This Project

This website aims to highlight Kenya's unique position in the renewable energy sector, particularly focusing on:

- Geothermal energy in the Great Rift Valley
- Solar power initiatives across the country
- Wind energy projects including Lake Turkana Wind Farm
- Hydropower developments
- Bioenergy innovations
- Mini-grid and smart systems

## Technical Details

The site is built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with responsive design)
- No JavaScript frameworks (keeping it simple)

## Next Steps

After lunch, I plan to:
1. Add high-quality images for each section
2. Complete the bioenergy section content (it got cut off)
3. Add more detailed statistics about Kenya's energy sector
4. Optimize for mobile viewing
5. Add some interactive elements

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my coursework in renewable energy systems, in engineering and my passion for seeing Kenya develop sustainable power solutions. I wanted to create an educational resource that highlights the engineering achievements happening right here in Kenya.

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you have suggestions or want to contribute! As a fellow engineering student, I'm always open to collaboration.



Now, off to get some food! Will be back to finish this up soon.
